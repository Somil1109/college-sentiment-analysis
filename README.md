# College Feedback Classifier (Hugging Face Chat API)

Automatically categorize student feedback using Large Language Models (LLMs) from Hugging Face, via their OpenAI-compatible Chat API (`huggingface_hub.InferenceClient`).  
Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for an interactive, no-code experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Flexible Classification:** Categorize feedback into custom categories (e.g., Academics, Facilities, Administration, Other).
- **Few-shot Learning:** Add example feedback for each category to guide the model ("few-shot" prompting).
- **CSV Upload:** Upload a CSV file with open-ended feedback (CSV must have a `feedback` column).
- **Batch Processing:** Automatically classifies all feedback rows in one click.
- **Download Results:** Download the classified feedback as a new CSV.
- **Model Choice:** Use any supported Hugging Face chat/instruct model (e.g., `Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct`, `meta-llama/Llama-3-8B-Instruct`).
- **No-code UI:** Everything works via a web interface‚Äîno coding required by the user!

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/college-feedback-classifier.git
cd college-feedback-classifier
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 3. Get a Hugging Face Access Token

- Sign up at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/join) if you don‚Äôt have an account.
- Go to [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and **create a token** with "read" permissions.

### 4. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run college_feedback_classifier_hfhub.py
```

### 5. Use the App

1. **Paste your Hugging Face token** and model id (e.g., `Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct`).
2. **Choose or add categories**.
3. **Provide at least one example feedback per category.**

## üôè Attribution

- Built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/index), and open LLMs.
- Inspired by the power of open-source LLMs for practical, no-code AI solutions.
